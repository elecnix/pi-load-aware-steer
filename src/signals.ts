/**
 * Band state machine shared by every signal this extension watches.
 *
 * A band is a neutral label for a range of a number: `normal`, `elevated`,
 * `high`. It carries no meaning about what should happen, and no action in
 * this extension is derived from it beyond deciding that a crossing occurred.
 *
 * The module is pure: no I/O, no pi imports, no timers. Everything is a
 * deterministic function of (current band, one sample, config), which is what
 * makes the hysteresis testable without a running session.
 *
 * The machine is unit-agnostic. Load passes a raw 1-minute average against a
 * load threshold; memory passes a fraction in [0, 1] against a fraction
 * threshold. Same arithmetic, separate state.
